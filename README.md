# Net_Practice

## Overview
This 42 project explores fundamental networking concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and packet forwarding. It includes scenarios where packets are sent between hosts, routers, and switches, analyzing their behavior and identifying potential issues like loops and misconfigured routes.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting**: Understanding network and broadcast addresses.
- **Routing & Forwarding**: How packets traverse networks using routing tables and gateways.
- **Switching**: Role of switches in forwarding packets within the same network.
- **Default Routes**: Configuring routers to handle unknown destinations.
- **Troubleshooting Network Loops**: Identifying and resolving loop issues in packet transmission.
